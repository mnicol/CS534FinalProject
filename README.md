# Partial Image Placement Software
Final project for computational photography.

The project is a tool for selecting parts of one image and placing them in a second image. It also blends the placed image portion into the second image to make it look as natural as possible. Right now the plan is to use poisson blending to make the placement look natural.

Here is a todo list of everything we need to get done. Feel free to break these up into smaller tasks if you want. If you are working on something denote it by your name and add your initial to the toto list item. For example I have (M) for one of the items.

TODO:
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Research poisson blending and techniques for implementing it in mat lab
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Break up the steps for implementing poisson blending into managable parts
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Get a working poisson blending example
  
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;(M) Research how to draw/select a rough reion on an image
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure out how to deal with a selected reigon and how to crop that portion of an image
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Research a method for refining a selected area (probably gradient related)
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Working example of a way to select reigons
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Working example of refining the selected reigon. It would be nice to have different sliders for how refined they want it
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;working example of cropped image
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;working example of placing the cropped image
  
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Research making a gui in java to work from. You can run java files from matlab as well
